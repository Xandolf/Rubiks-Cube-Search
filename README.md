# Rubiks-Cube-Search
The purpose of this python program is to analyze different search heuristics for the problem of searching for the correct action sequence to solve a rubiks cube. 
As the layers of a rubik's cube increases so will the time taken for each search. We will analyze the time complexity in nodes expanded for each of the searchs/heuristics.

Searches to be implemented include:
  Breadth First Search
  Depth First Search
  A* Search (with heuristics)
    Manhattan Distance
    Misplaced Tiles
    Entropy
    Gini
